# Building a Compiler for Your X Language From First Principles

Building a compiler without any existing high-level tools is a fascinating journey that takes us back to the foundations of computing. I'll outline the process for creating a minimal compiler targeting macOS ARM chips to run just your main function with "hello world" functionality.

## Starting Point: The Bootstrapping Problem

You're asking about what's known as the "bootstrapping problem" in compiler development - how do we build compilers without already having compilers? This is how early computer scientists had to work.

## Step 1: Starting with Assembly Language

Since we don't have C/C++/LLVM, we need to start at the lowest practical level:

1. **Learn ARM64 Assembly for macOS**: Apple's ARM chips use the ARM64 (AArch64) instruction set. You'll need to understand:
   - Basic instructions (arithmetic, logic, memory operations)
   - Register usage on ARM64
   - macOS ARM64 calling conventions
   - System call interface for macOS on ARM

2. **Create an Assembler**: First, you'd need to write a program that translates human-readable assembly into machine code:
   - Initially, this might be done manually using binary or hexadecimal encoding
   - Then create a simple assembler in assembly itself (self-hosting)
   - This would be your most fundamental tool

## Step 2: Building a Basic Lexer and Parser

1. **Write a Lexer in Assembly**: Tokenize your X language source code:
   - Read input text character by character
   - Recognize tokens (keywords, identifiers, literals, operators)
   - Output a stream of tokens

2. **Write a Parser in Assembly**: Process the token stream according to your EBNF grammar:
   - Implement recursive descent parsing for your grammar
   - Build an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) in memory
   - Handle syntax errors

## Step 3: Code Generation for ARM64

1. **Develop an ARM64 Code Generator**:
   - Traverse the AST
   - Map language constructs to appropriate ARM64 instructions
   - Handle memory allocation and register assignment
   - Generate code for standard library functions (like print)

2. **Implement System Calls**:
   - Create interfaces to macOS ARM64 system calls
   - Specifically implement write() for your hello world output
   - Set up proper function prologue/epilogue according to macOS ARM64 ABI

## Step 4: Creating a Minimal Runtime

1. **Implement Entry Point Logic**:
   - Set up proper stack and register state for macOS ARM64
   - Call your main() function
   - Handle program termination

2. **Output Machine Code**:
   - Generate a Mach-O executable format (macOS's native format)
   - Set appropriate headers and sections
   - Make the file executable

## Step 5: For Hello World Specifically

For your minimal hello world, you need:

1. A parser that recognizes just:
   - Function declarations (at least main())
   - Print statements
   - String literals

2. Code generation for:
   - Setting up the main function
   - Invoking system calls to output text
   - Properly returning from main

## Specific Focus for macOS ARM64

For macOS ARM64 specifics:

1. **Mach-O Format**: You'll need to generate a valid Mach-O binary:
   - Header with ARM64 architecture specified
   - Text section containing your code
   - Data section for strings

2. **System Calls**: macOS uses the Unix-like syscall interface on ARM64:
   - For hello world, you'll primarily need the write syscall (0x2000004)
   - Register x16 holds the syscall number on ARM64 macOS
   - Arguments go in registers x0-x7

3. **Function Calling**: Following ARM64 macOS ABI:
   - First 8 arguments in registers x0-x7
   - Return values in x0
   - Stack must be 16-byte aligned

## Practical Approach

Realistically, this would be done in stages:

1. Start with a minimal hand-written assembler
2. Use that to write a slightly more powerful assembler
3. Use that improved assembler to write your compiler tools
4. Gradually build up from handling just the main function to more complex features

This approach follows the natural evolution of compiler development throughout computing history - each generation of tools making it easier to build the next generation.

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of this compiler development process?
